I am currently pursuing my B.Tech degree from ITER (Institute of Technical Education and Research), Siksha 'o' Anusandhan, located in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. I completed my 12th grade from Asansol North Point School and my 10th grade from DAV Public School. I am a resident of Asansol, West Bengal.

                My aspiration is to become a Full Stack Developer, and I am passionate about learning new things in the world of programming. Apart from programming, I also enjoy playing badminton.
